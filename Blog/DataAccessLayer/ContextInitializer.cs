It bears the design cues of its bigger siblings, and we find it to be a major improvement. That's despite the fact that it's a relatively minor update, leaving the interior nearly unchanged.</p> <p>At the front, the <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g70/\">G70</a> adopts the pentagonal grille and quad headlights of the <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g80/\" data-rapid_p=\"21\" data-v9y=\"1\">G80</a>. The main grille looks shorter than the old one, but wider. The lower fascia features new grilles and large outboard units that are less cluttered and awkward than the openings and accent lights on <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2019/02/12/2019-hyundai-genesis-g70-driving-review/\" data-rapid_p=\"22\" data-v9y=\"1\">the outgoing G70</a>.</p> <p>The sides of the car aren't majorly changed except for the front fenders. The large fake, chrome-adorned vents have morphed into small simple openings in the lower sections of the fenders. There aren't any accent or turn signal lights in the fenders like on the G80 and <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g90/\" data-rapid_p=\"23\" data-v9y=\"1\">G90</a>.</p> <p>The shape of the rear is fairly similar to the current model, but simple changes make it look more different than it is. Quad taillights mirror the headlights, but fill about the same area as the old dual taillights. The license plate area moves down into the bumper, and the trunk now has \"GENESIS\" spelled out across it.</p> <p><img class=\"grp-full lazy\" data-headline=\"undefined\" data-summary=\"undefined\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1600x900/format/jpg/quality/85/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/489ba000-f29c-11ea-9b03-9a07f5e95560\" style=\"\"></p> <p>The interior is almost completely unchanged.

It's a toss-up whether it will get a carryover twin-turbo 3.3-liter V6 or <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/08/11/2021-genesis-g80-review/\" data-rapid_p=\"26\" data-v9y=\"1\">the new turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 from the G80</a>.

It's powered by a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 255 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive comes standard, and 4Matic all-wheel drive is a $2,500 option.</p> <p>Next up in the sedan hierarchy is the E450, which is priced at $63,050 and is exclusively offered with 4Matic. It receives a 362-horsepower, 3.0-liter straight-six engine paired with a 48-volt mild <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/hybrid/\" data-rapid_p=\"25\" data-v9y=\"1\">hybrid</a> system.</p> <p>From there, the way to the top of the sedan range takes buyers through AMG-controlled territory. The E53 ($74,950) receives a 429-horsepower version of the aforementioned six, while the full-fat E63 S ($108,550) carries on with its predecessor's 4.0-liter V8, which is twin-turbocharged to 603 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque.</p> <p>If you want two doors, you'll need to content yourself with the 3.0-liter straight-six. Coupe and convertible buyers have two models to choose from called E450 and E53, respectively, and the former is offered with rear- or all-wheel drive. Plan on spending $66,000 for an E450 Coupe, $73,000 for an E450 <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/mini/convertible/\" data-rapid_p=\"26\" data-v9y=\"0\">Convertible</a>, $77,300 for an E53 Coupe, and $83,900 for an E53 Convertible. 4Matic remains priced at $2,500.</p> <p>Got kids, kayaks, or both? It's the wagon you're likely after, then, and your options are limited to the E450 All-Terrain or the E63 S. More rugged-looking and a little bit taller than the standard long-roof E-Class, the All-Terrain (pictured) starts at $68,650. It's new to the American market, though it has been available in Europe and in a handful of other global markets since 2016, and it replaces the regular E-Class station wagon on the American market. Finally, the flagship E63 S and its hand-built, 603-horsepower V8 will set you back $113,500.&nbsp;</p> <p>All three body styles will enter the 2021 model year with styling tweaks inside and out, and more technology inside. Looking ahead, <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/mercedes_benz/\" data-rapid_p=\"27\" data-v9y=\"0\">Mercedes</a> plans to add a gasoline-electric <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/tag/plug-in+hybrid/\" data-rapid_p=\"28\" data-v9y=\"1\">plug-in hybrid</a> model to the range.</p> <p>Mercedes-Benz <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/\" data-rapid_p=\"29\" data-v9y=\"1\">dealers</a> across the nation will begin receiving the updated E-Class by the end of 2020.

The whirring and raw mechanical goodness is there at idle, and it only gets better as the revs climb.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking advantage of this model’s all-wheel-drive system is the first thing on our minds. Porsche claims to have improved the front axle drive componentry for the 992. The clutch and differential are now water-cooled, and it features reinforced clutches. This increases both durability and load capacity, and it also allows for a more accurate adjustment of clutch force. The greater capability of the driven front axle should result in better traction and handling in all conditions, wet and dry. In most circumstances, the majority of the torque heads rearward (up to 100 percent). Unlike some all-wheel-drive performance cars, though, the 911 Carrera 4 doesn’t have a mode that fully disconnects the front axle.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Activating launch control seems like the most obvious way to see how well Porsche is able to put all 443 horses to the ground. Just like every other new Porsche these days, </span></i><a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/05/05/2020-porsche-macan-turbo-exhaust-launch/\" data-rapid_p=\"14\" data-v9y=\"0\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the launch</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> experience is akin to being punched in the chest. The engine revs up to 5,000 rpm, then you’re rocketed away without hesitation or lag as the eight-speed PDK transmission does its job flawlessly.

It bears the design cues of its bigger siblings, and we find it to be a major improvement. That's despite the fact that it's a relatively minor update, leaving the interior nearly unchanged.</p> <p>At the front, the <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g70/\">G70</a> adopts the pentagonal grille and quad headlights of the <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g80/\" data-rapid_p=\"21\" data-v9y=\"1\">G80</a>. The main grille looks shorter than the old one, but wider. The lower fascia features new grilles and large outboard units that are less cluttered and awkward than the openings and accent lights on <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2019/02/12/2019-hyundai-genesis-g70-driving-review/\" data-rapid_p=\"22\" data-v9y=\"1\">the outgoing G70</a>.</p> <p>The sides of the car aren't majorly changed except for the front fenders. The large fake, chrome-adorned vents have morphed into small simple openings in the lower sections of the fenders. There aren't any accent or turn signal lights in the fenders like on the G80 and <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/g90/\" data-rapid_p=\"23\" data-v9y=\"1\">G90</a>.</p> <p>The shape of the rear is fairly similar to the current model, but simple changes make it look more different than it is. Quad taillights mirror the headlights, but fill about the same area as the old dual taillights. The license plate area moves down into the bumper, and the trunk now has \"GENESIS\" spelled out across it.</p> <p><img class=\"grp-full lazy\" data-headline=\"undefined\" data-summary=\"undefined\" src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1600x900/format/jpg/quality/85/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/489ba000-f29c-11ea-9b03-9a07f5e95560\" style=\"\"></p> <p>The interior is almost completely unchanged. The one exception is the infotainment. The G70 now gets a 10.25-inch display and a new Genesis-specific interface.</p> <p><a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/genesis/\" data-rapid_p=\"24\" data-v9y=\"1\">Genesis</a> hasn't yet said if any mechanical changes have been made. We're expecting it to get the new turbocharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder, <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/08/27/2021-kia-stinger-powertrains-revealed/\" data-rapid_p=\"25\" data-v9y=\"1\">which makes 300 horsepower and 311 pound-feet of torque in the updated Kia Stinger</a>. It's a toss-up whether it will get a carryover twin-turbo 3.3-liter V6 or <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/08/11/2021-genesis-g80-review/\" data-rapid_p=\"26\" data-v9y=\"1\">the new turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 from the G80</a>. We do know that <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/07/23/genesis-g70-loses-manual-transmission/\" data-rapid_p=\"27\" data-v9y=\"1\">there won't be a manual transmission offered</a> this time around.</p> <p>Genesis said it will have more details, likely including mechanical specs, next month. Launch window and possibly pricing could also be announced then.</p>",

Sedan, coupe and station wagon models will arrive for the 2021 model year.</p> <p>Pricing for <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2020/03/03/2021-mercedes-benz-e-class-refresh-revealed/\" data-rapid_p=\"24\" data-v9y=\"1\">the 2021 E350 sedan</a> starts at $55,300 once a mandatory $1,050 destination charge is added to the bottom line. It's powered by a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 255 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive comes standard, and 4Matic all-wheel drive is a $2,500 option.</p> <p>Next up in the sedan hierarchy is the E450, which is priced at $63,050 and is exclusively offered with 4Matic. It receives a 362-horsepower, 3.0-liter straight-six engine paired with a 48-volt mild <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/hybrid/\" data-rapid_p=\"25\" data-v9y=\"1\">hybrid</a> system.</p> <p>From there, the way to the top of the sedan range takes buyers through AMG-controlled territory. The E53 ($74,950) receives a 429-horsepower version of the aforementioned six, while the full-fat E63 S ($108,550) carries on with its predecessor's 4.0-liter V8, which is twin-turbocharged to 603 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque.</p> <p>If you want two doors, you'll need to content yourself with the 3.0-liter straight-six. Coupe and convertible buyers have two models to choose from called E450 and E53, respectively, and the former is offered with rear- or all-wheel drive. Plan on spending $66,000 for an E450 Coupe, $73,000 for an E450 <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/mini/convertible/\" data-rapid_p=\"26\" data-v9y=\"0\">Convertible</a>, $77,300 for an E53 Coupe, and $83,900 for an E53 Convertible. 4Matic remains priced at $2,500.</p> <p>Got kids, kayaks, or both? It's the wagon you're likely after, then, and your options are limited to the E450 All-Terrain or the E63 S. More rugged-looking and a little bit taller than the standard long-roof E-Class, the All-Terrain (pictured) starts at $68,650. It's new to the American market, though it has been available in Europe and in a handful of other global markets since 2016, and it replaces the regular E-Class station wagon on the American market. Finally, the flagship E63 S and its hand-built, 603-horsepower V8 will set you back $113,500.&nbsp;</p> <p>All three body styles will enter the 2021 model year with styling tweaks inside and out, and more technology inside.

Porsche claims to have improved the front axle drive componentry for the 992. The clutch and differential are now water-cooled, and it features reinforced clutches. This increases both durability and load capacity, and it also allows for a more accurate adjustment of clutch force. The greater capability of the driven front axle should result in better traction and handling in all conditions, wet and dry. In most circumstances, the majority of the torque heads rearward (up to 100 percent). Unlike some all-wheel-drive performance cars, though, the 911 Carrera 4 doesn’t have a mode that fully disconnects the front axle.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Activating launch control seems like the most obvious way to see how well Porsche is able to put all 443 horses to the ground.

It's powered by a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that generates 255 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive comes standard, and 4Matic all-wheel drive is a $2,500 option.</p> <p>Next up in the sedan hierarchy is the E450, which is priced at $63,050 and is exclusively offered with 4Matic. It receives a 362-horsepower, 3.0-liter straight-six engine paired with a 48-volt mild <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/hybrid/\" data-rapid_p=\"25\" data-v9y=\"1\">hybrid</a> system.</p> <p>From there, the way to the top of the sedan range takes buyers through AMG-controlled territory. The E53 ($74,950) receives a 429-horsepower version of the aforementioned six, while the full-fat E63 S ($108,550) carries on with its predecessor's 4.0-liter V8, which is twin-turbocharged to 603 horsepower and 627 pound-feet of torque.</p> <p>If you want two doors, you'll need to content yourself with the 3.0-liter straight-six. Coupe and convertible buyers have two models to choose from called E450 and E53, respectively, and the former is offered with rear- or all-wheel drive. Plan on spending $66,000 for an E450 Coupe, $73,000 for an E450 <a class=\"injectedLinkmain\" href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/mini/convertible/\" data-rapid_p=\"26\" data-v9y=\"0\">Convertible</a>, $77,300 for an E53 Coupe, and $83,900 for an E53 Convertible. 4Matic remains priced at $2,500.</p> <p>Got kids, kayaks, or both? It's the wagon you're likely after, then, and your options are limited to the E450 All-Terrain or the E63 S. More rugged-looking and a little bit taller than the standard long-roof E-Class, the All-Terrain (pictured) starts at $68,650. It's new to the American market, though it has been available in Europe and in a handful of other global markets since 2016, and it replaces the regular E-Class station wagon on the American market. Finally, the flagship E63 S and its hand-built, 603-horsepower V8 will set you back $113,500.&nbsp;</p> <p>All three body styles will enter the 2021 model year with styling tweaks inside and out, and more technology inside.
